# EatingHouse
A user-friendly Java application that allows authentication of two types of users: client and administrator. If you want to register, you can create a client account.
The administrator can add, delete or edit products, create menus consisting of several products and he can request the generation of certain sales reports. 
The client can view the available products, filter them according to certain criteria, start an order, select and add products to the order list,
place the order and download the bill. This application does not use a database but uses serialization for data persistence. For GUI I use Java Swing.
